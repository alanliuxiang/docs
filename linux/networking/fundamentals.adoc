== TCP/IP 五层模型

* *Physical* - The physical layer represents the physical devices that interconnect computers, which includes the specifications for the networking cables and the connectors that join devices together along with specifications describing how signals are sent over these connections.
* *Data Link* - While the physical layer is all about cabling, connectors and sending signals, the data link layer is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals, so network devices can communicate. The most common prototol in this layer is Ethernet, which specifies physical layer attributes, and defines a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.
* *Network* - It also called called the Internet layer, which allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers. While the data link layer is responsible for getting data across a single link, the network layer is responsible for getting data delivered across a collection of networks. The most common protocol used at this layer is known as IP or Internet Protocol.
* *Transport* -  While the network layer delivers data between two individual nodes, the transport layer sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data. TCP is the most commonly used protocol in the fourth layer. IP is responsible for getting data from one node to another; TCP and UDP is responsible for ensuring that data gets to the right applications running on those nodes.
* *Application* -  There are lots of different application-specific protocols at this layer, which used to allow you to browse the web or send receive email are some common ones.

1. The physical layer is the delivery truck and the roads.
2. The data link layer is how the delivery trucks get from one intersection to the next over and over.
3. The network layer identifies which roads need to be taken to get from address A to address B.
4. The transport layer ensures that delivery driver knows how to knock on your door to tell you your package has arrived.
5. The application layer is the contents of the package itself.

=== Cables

Cables are what connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them.

Cables 可分为两类:

* Copper - Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable. They're made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside plastic insulator. The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. These categories have different physical characteristics like the number of twists in the pair of copper wires that result in different usable lengths and transfer rates.
* Fiber(fiber optic cables) - Fiber cables contain individual optical fibers which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair. These tubes of glass can transport beams of light. Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages, fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data.

=== Hub

A hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. All the devices connected to a hub will end up talking to all other devices at the same time. It's up to each system connected to the hub to determine if the incoming data was meant for them, or to ignore it if it isn't. This causes a lot of noise on the network and creates what's called a collision domain. A collision domain is a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other. This causes these systems to have to wait for a quiet period before they try sending their data again. It really slows down network communications, and is the primary reason hubs are fairly rare. 

=== Switch

A switch is a much more common way of connecting many computers is with a more sophisticated device. A switch is very similar to a hub, since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate. The difference is that while a hub is a layer 1 or physical layer device, a switch is a level 2 or data link device. This means that a switch can actually inspect the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and then only send that data to that one system. This reduces or even completely eliminates the size of collision domains on a network. This also lead to fewer retransmissions and a higher overall throughput.

=== Router

A router is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. While a hub is a layer one device and a switch is a layer two device. A router operates at layer three, a network layer. Just like a switch can inspect Ethernet data to determine where to send things, a router can inspect IP data to determine where to send things. Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between lots of different networks all over the world. 

Routers share data with each other via a protocol known as BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol. That lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic. When you open a web browser and load a web page, the traffic between computers and the web servers could have traveled over dozens of different routers. The Internet is incredibly large and complicated. And routers are global guides for getting traffic to the right places.
