== 收集和查看 sos report 

[source, text]
.*执行 sosreport 收集*
----
# sosreport
----

NOTE: `sosreport` 执行可能需要一段时间，并且执行过程中需要输入一些信息，例如红帽账户名、红帽问题单号等，命令执行完会在 `/var/tmp` 下产生一个以 *sosreport-* 开头的文件。

# cd /var/tmp/
# tar -xvJf sosreport-kylin.016001789-20180215001511.tar.xz
# cd sosreport-kylin.016001789-20180215001511/
