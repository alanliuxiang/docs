== Login to the OpenShift

The first thing we want to do to ensure that our `oc` command line tools was installed and successfully added to our path is login to the OpenShift environment that has been provided for this Roadshow session. In order to login, we will use the `oc` command and then specify the server that we want to authenticate to. Issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc login https://master.example.com
----

You may see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

== Using a project

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work. For this first lab, we are going to use a project named smoke that has been created and populated with an application for you.

During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make sure that things in the environment are working as expected. Don’t worry if you don’t understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in detail in later labs.

The first thing we want to do is create the **project-userXY** project. You can do this with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project project-ksoong
----

== The Web Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web console works, open your browser and go to the following URL:

https://master.example.com

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter in the following credentials:

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a list of projects that your user has permission to work with. You will see something that looks like the following image:

Click on the project-userXY project. When you click on the project-userXY project, you will be taken to the project overview page which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have running as part of your project. There’s nothing there now, but that’s about to change.

We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs. Get ready!
