= Creating Routes by Exposing Services Application description

In this section, we’re going to make our application visible to the end users, so they can access it.

== Background: Routes

While `Services` provide internal abstraction and load balancing within an OpenShift environment, sometimes clients (users, systems, devices, etc.) outside of OpenShift need to access an application. The way that external clients are able to access applications running in OpenShift is through the OpenShift routing layer. And the data object behind that is a `Route`.

The default OpenShift router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection. You can optionally define security, such as TLS, for the `Route`. If you want your `Services`, and, by extension, your `Pods`, to be accessible to the outside world, you need to create a `Route`.

== Exercise: Creating a Route

Fortunately, creating a `Route` is a pretty straight-forward process. You simply expose the `Service` via the command line. Or, via the web console, just click the "Create Route" button associated with the service.

First we want to verify that we don’t already have any existing routes:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get route 
No resources found.
----

Now we need to get the `Service` name to expose:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get services
NAME       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
parksmap   172.30.32.109   <none>        8080/TCP   2h
----

Once we know the `Service` name, creating a `Route` is a simple one-command task:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc expose service parksmap 
route "parksmap" exposed
----

Verify the `Route` was created with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get route 
----

You can also verify the `Route` by looking at the project in the OpenShift web console:

Pretty nifty, huh? This application is now available at the URL shown in the web console. Click the link and you will see:
