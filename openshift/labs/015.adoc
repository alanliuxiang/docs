= Deploy a SpringBoot Application
:toc: manual
:toc-placement: preamble

In this recipe we will deploy a SpringBoot application using a custom source to image builder image.

== Create project

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-project spring-sample-app
----

== SpringBoot S2I Builder

Create a new application using SpringBoot S2I Builder image. Here we will deploy sample code from a git repository 


[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-app veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base~https://github.com/jbosschina/spring-sample-app.git --name=bootapp
--> Found Docker image c3ddd9e (8 months old) from Docker Hub for "veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base"

    Spring Boot Maven 3 
    ------------------- 
    Platform for building and running Spring Boot applications

    Tags: builder, java, java8, maven, maven3, springboot

    * An image stream will be created as "spring-mvn-base:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/jbosschina/spring-sample-app.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "bootapp:latest"
      * Every time "spring-mvn-base:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "bootapp"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "bootapp"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "bootapp"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream "spring-mvn-base" created
    imagestream "bootapp" created
    buildconfig "bootapp" created
    deploymentconfig "bootapp" created
    service "bootapp" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/bootapp' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

Expose Service to create a route

[source, bash]
----
$ oc expose service bootapp 
route "bootapp" exposed
----

Check the route

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get route 
NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bootapp   bootapp-spring-sample-app.apps.example.com             bootapp    8080-tcp                 None
----

Wait for your application to be built and deployed.

== Verify

Test your application by using the hostname assigned in the route.

Congratulations! You are now running a SpringBoot application on OpenShift.
