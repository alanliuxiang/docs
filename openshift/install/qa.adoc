.*原因及解决办法*
----
The use of NFS for the core OpenShift Components was never recommended, as NFS (and the NFS Protocol) does not 
provide the proper consistency needed for the applications that make up the OpenShift infrastructure.

As a result, the installer/update playbooks now require an option to enable the use of NFS with core infrastructure components.

In ansible inventory file you should specify the following:

openshift_enable_unsupported_configurations=True
