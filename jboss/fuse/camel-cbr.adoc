<!--
   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the bundle is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the Camel namespaces.
-->
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
             http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd
             http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint/camel-blueprint.xsd">

    <!--
      The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'. Additionally,
      we can also define namespace prefixes we want to use them in the XPath expressions in our CBR.

      While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> elements, it is a good idea
      to set those for runtime management purposes (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)
    -->
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint" xmlns:order="http://fabric8.com/examples/order/v7"
        id="cbr-example-context">

        <!--
          When this route is started, it will automatically create the work/cbr/input directory where you can drop the
          file that need to be processed.

          The <log/> elements are used to add human-friendly business logging statements. They make it easier to see what the
          route is doing.

          The <choice/> element contains the content based router. The two <when/> clauses use XPath to define the criteria 
          for entering that part of the route. When the country in the XML message is set to UK or US, the file will be 
          moved to a directory for that country. The <otherwise/> element ensures that any file that does not meet the 
          requirements for either of the <when/> elements will be moved to the work/cbr/output/others directory.
        -->
        <route id="cbr-route">
            <from uri="file:work/cbr/input" />
            <log message="Receiving order ${file:name}" />
