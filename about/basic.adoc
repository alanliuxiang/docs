|名称 |说明

|EDB(External Data Bus)
|interconnect the parts of computer, 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits and 64 bits. CPU recieve voltage singals throw EDB.

|Register
|Inside the CPU, store the Data that CPU work with

|MCC(Memory Controller Chip)
|The bridge between CPU and RAM

|Address Bus
|Connect the CPU and MCC

|Overclocking
|Increases the rate of CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.

|CPU
|2 major types of CPU sockets: Land grid array(LGA), Pin grid array(PGA). 32-bit and 64-bit CPU architecture.

|RAM
|Computer short-term memory. 

|Motherboards
|The foundation that holds computer together.

== What is The Cloud?

* The cloud is the future.

*定义：* - Cloud computing is a technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way so that lots of users get what they need when they need it. 

*核心技术：* - Hardware virtualization is a core concept of how cloud computing technologies work. It allows the concept of a physical machine and a logical machine to be abstracted away from each other.

* *Virtualization* - A single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests.
* *Hypervisor* - A hypervisor is a piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware.

* *Public cloud* - A large cluster of machines run by another company. 
* *Private cloud* -  A private cloud takes the same concepts of public cloud, but instead, it's entirely used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its own premises.
* *Hybrid cloud* - A term used to describe situations where companies might run things like their most sensitive proprietary technologies on a private cloud while entrusting their less sensitive servers to a public cloud.

*Cloud Computing:* A new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a better way.
